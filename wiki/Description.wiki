http://gap-analysis-cwr.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/img/CWR_logo_thumb.png Adapting agriculture to climate change is one of the most urgent challenges of our time. There is, quite simply, no more important step we can take to prepare for climate change than to ensure that the crops that feed humanity are adapted. The need for new crop varieties that can be productive in the new climates of the future is now widely recognized. It is much less well known that our ability to breed these new varieties cannot be taken for granted. The greatest source of untapped diversity, and in particular the richest source of diversity for adaptive characteristics needed to confront the challenges of climate change, are the wild relatives of our crops. Not only are these largely uncollected, and therefore unevaluated and unavailable to plant breeders and thus to farmers, many are also at risk of extinction. This project will ensure that we win the race to collect crop wild relatives, protect them, and prepare them for use in plant breeding programmes in time to breed new crop varieties adapted to new climates.

The project is focused on the species related to 26 crops of major importance to food security. It will:

 * identify those crop wild relatives that are missing from existing collections, are most likely to contain diversity of value to adapting agriculture to climate change, and are most endangered;
 * collect them from the wild;
 * provide them to genebanks for conservation;
 * prepare these and others already in collections (‘pre-breeding’) for use in breeding crops for new climates;
 * evaluate them for useful traits; and
 * make the resulting information widely available.

The pre-bred material incorporating the desired traits will be directly fed into ongoing, active and successful breeding initiatives aimed at helping poor farmers in developing countries increase food production, and made available to on-farm improvement efforts and farmers as appropriate. The project will run for ten years. It will introduce a range of new and exciting adaptive options for agriculture that might otherwise have been lost, whilst helping protect biodiversity from disappearing. The project will help build capacity in developing countries and will produce valuable information to assist in complementary on-farm and in situ efforts. Importantly, it will further implementation of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture.

= 2. Objective =

A portfolio of plants, with the characteristics required for adapting the world’s most important food crops to climate change, is collected, protected and prepared in a form that plant breeders can readily use to produce varieties adapted to future climatic conditions that farmers in the developing world will soon be encountering.
